Small kata for string reverser. I did a local installation of expect.js using

```npm install expect.js```

and then I ran the tests with

```mocha --watch spec.js```

This worked because I have lot's of stuff installed globally on my system.
I know I should have included a package.json file but I'm a bad person so I didn't.
Sorry. :O)
